                <p>
                    <a href="https://lambdaschool.com/">Lambda School</a> is a
                    30 week, immersive program that provides the tools and
                    training needed to launch a new careerâ€”from the comfort of
                    home. As students graduate and accept job offers, many are
                    seeing huge salary increases. Over time, salary increases of
                    this magnitude create a significant amount of wealth that
                    can be further compounded through smart financial planning
                    and investing. With a few simple inputs, Compound shows
                    future earnings for your current job as well as potential
                    future earnings after Lambda School.
